# Persnickety

Persnickety is an OAS3 / Swagger [(Open API Spec version 3)](https://swagger.io/specification/) helper tool.

It currently contains:

- A generator for path and model specifications
- A request validator for path, query and body parameters (Express middleware)

### Why?

Swagger is super useful, but it lacks the necessary tools to make its use easier and more context specific when it comes to Express routes.
